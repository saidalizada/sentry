## Step 1: Create a Sentry Account

1. Go to the [Sentry website](https://sentry.io/) and sign up for an account if you don't have one.

2. Once logged in, create a new organization and project for your tutorial.

3. In your project settings, locate and copy the DSN (Data Source Name) provided by Sentry. This DSN will be used to connect your application to Sentry for error tracking.
