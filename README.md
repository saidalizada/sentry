## Step 1: Create a Sentry Account

1. Go to the [Sentry website](https://sentry.io/) and sign up for an account if you don't have one.

2. Once logged in, create a new organization and project for your tutorial.

3. In your project settings, locate and copy the DSN (Data Source Name) provided by Sentry. This DSN will be used to connect your application to Sentry for error tracking.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Project

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line.

2. Initialize a virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the necessary packages:
    ```sh
    pip install Flask  # For Flask
    pip install sentry-sdk
