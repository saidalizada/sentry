## Step 1: Create a Sentry Account

1. Go to the [Sentry website](https://sentry.io/) and sign up for an account if you don't have one.

2. Once logged in, create a new organization and project for your tutorial.

3. In your project settings, locate and copy the DSN (Data Source Name) provided by Sentry. This DSN will be used to connect your application to Sentry for error tracking.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Project

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line.

2. Initialize a virtual environment:

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the necessary packages:
    ```sh
    pip install Flask  # For Flask
    pip install sentry-sdk

## Step 3: Integrate Sentry with Flask using Division by Zero Exception

1. **Create a New File:** Create a new file named `app.py` in your project directory.

2. **Run the Application:** Run your Flask application by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   flask run

Access http://localhost:5000 in your browser to trigger the exception.

3. **Monitor with Sentry:**

- Log in to your Sentry account and navigate to your project.
- In the Sentry dashboard, you should see the captured exception event.
- Click on the event to view its details, including the error message, stack trace, and context.

4. **Understanding Sentry:**

- Sentry automatically captures and reports errors and exceptions that occur in your application.
- When an error is triggered, Sentry collects information like the error message, stack trace, request details, and more.
- This information helps you diagnose and fix issues in your application quickly.
